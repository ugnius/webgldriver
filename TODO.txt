 MAIN MENU CAMERA COMPOSITION <
 GUI TEXT OCCLUSION
 BACKFACE CULLING
 Basic JOYSTICK CONTROLLS
 WORLD OBJECTS
 BUY CAR
 Update models
 port ground
 file optimization
 LOGOUT TO MAIN MENU
 CAR front camera
 only integrate past frames when returning after blur timeouts
 refactor ws class ( class could be ranamed, otherwise ok )
 fix corupt frames ( corupt frames were caused by TCP packets clustering together, TCP packets are now beeing split )
 full Joystick controlls
 
 sound loader errors
 FIX: can not reverse downhill
 FIX: correct downshifting
 ADD: vignette uniforms (blood collor yay?)
 FIX: speedometer, alooring absolute number
 ADD: Tripple rainbow
 ADD: (mute)silence game on blur
 
 ADD: Colormap post effect
 ADD: Chromatic aberration post effect
 ADD: Motion blurr post effect
 

TODO:
 

 CHECKPOINTS RACE
 CAR SPECS
 FF Joystick
 Fix commands
 GUI aspect ratio
 lower terrain not road ( will cause changes to water level )
 changing camera back causes NaNs ( hard to reproduce, will fix when found )
 test JPEG encoding
 
 float camera (sin/cos?)
 load time stuff;
 Collisions
 Networking
 Texture supersampling ( rotated cuve )
 user camera collisions
 
 optimize object filtering
 blend depth caching
 refractod shaders to support full world light collor mapping
 
 file index
 class index
 group shaders to one file
 CAR RESET with delay
 
 car state is not uniform even when no frames are dropped ( check states, integration, contol frame timing )
 show network status ( user should be able to see network stats, possibly TAB network bars, ping times )
 try to reconnect after dropped connection, ( client side, always )
 disconnect user if network is down for long, 5 seconds (  )
 TAB show player list and pings ( small 3d text ovelaping, player names, network stats )
 drop players if no frames received recently, (ping before),
 
 wait for ping calculation before connecting to server
 background loop to keep alive for server.
 
BUGS:
 
 Sound changing menu reseting sound
